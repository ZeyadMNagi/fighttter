### Pages Explanation:

- ### The Main Page:
  - this is where you can select the mode between `Single Player` and `Multiplayer`.
  - there are many characters to choose from.

  - after selecting a character you will be asked to pick the background for that character.
    - currently we have many backgrouns for each character.

  - if you chose `Single Player` mode you will also need to select the Difficulty level which includes:
    - `Easy` 
    - `Medium`
    - `Hard`

#### Note: In Multiplayer mode only one player can control each character at a time so you should choose wisely.

- ### Room Mode:
  - This page is under development so far.
  - In this mode you will be able to create or join a room.
  - when creating a new room you will need to enter the room name and password.
  - once you created the room you will be redirected to the game page with your own room.
  - If you want to join an existing room you just need to enter the room's name and password.
