🎮 To start playing:
  - Choose the mode from the main page 🕹️
  - Then choose your character 🦸‍♂️
  - Then the background 🌆
  - Then the difficulty (if you play in single-player mode) 🌟

🎮 The rooms mode is not completed yet but I'm still working on it 💪

📃 Pages Explanation:

- 🏠 The Main Page:
  - This is where you can select the mode between `Single Player` and `Multiplayer` 🕹️👥.
  - There are many characters to choose from 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️.

  - After selecting a character, you will be asked to pick the background for that character 🌆.
    - Currently, we have many backgrounds for each character 🖼️.

  - If you chose `Single Player` mode, you will also need to select the Difficulty level which includes:
    - `Easy` 🌟
    - `Medium` 🌟🌟
    - `Hard` 🌟🌟🌟

#### Note: In Multiplayer mode, only one player can control each character at a time, so you should choose wisely. 💡

- 🚧 Room Mode:
  - This page is under development so far 🏗️.
  - In this mode, you will be able to create or join a room.
  - When creating a new room, you will need to enter the room name and password 🔑.
  - Once you create the room, you will be redirected to the game page with your own room 🎮.
  - If you want to join an existing room, you just need to enter the room's name and password 🔑.
